Chorus is a declarative, modular configuration helper for Neovim. Structure
your configuration as self-contained files that declare what packages they
require; Chorus executes them "simultaneously" as coroutines and installs
packages as efficient batches with `vim.pack` (Neovim 0.12+ required).

## Getting Started

See [the documentation](https://bkoropoff.github.io/chorus/) for details.
